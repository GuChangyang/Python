Intercom is a project that like we have some customer records in a text file  one customer per line, JSON-encoded. We want to invite any customer within 100km of our Dublin office (GPS coordinates 53.3381985, -6.2592576) for some food and drinks on us.

the program will read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100 km), sorted by user id (ascending).
